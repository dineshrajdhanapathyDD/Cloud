## My AWS Challenge

I'm taking on the AWS Beginners Challenge! Over 4 projects, I will launch resources like EC2, S3, Quicksight and use IAM using AWS services. I’m learning AWS because I want to strengthen my cloud skills, gain hands-on experience, and work toward becoming an AWS DevOps Engineer. Real projects help me move beyond theory and build the confidence I need to support cloud-based development and deployment in real-world environments.

### Hold Me Accountable!

I'm challenging myself to complete all 4 projects in the next 4 days. To make it happen, I will keep myself accountable by staying focused, tracking daily progress, and sharing updates. My reward for completing this challenge will be a deeper understanding of AWS services like EC2 for compute, S3 for storage, QuickSight for data visualization, and IAM for secure user management—key tools to build real-world cloud solutions confidently.

## What is Cloud?

Before cloud computing, we had to rely on our own physical hardware to store data, run software, and manage everything locally. This limited scalability, accessibility, and performance. Now with cloud computing, we can access powerful servers, storage, and applications over the internet from anywhere. It enables streaming, online collaboration, and scalable app development without needing to own or maintain the infrastructure ourselves.

### What is AWS?

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the leading cloud platform that provides on-demand computing resources like storage, databases, networking, and more over the internet. Instead of owning physical servers, businesses and developers use AWS to build, deploy, and scale applications quickly and cost-effectively. With a global network of data centers, AWS powers about a third of the world’s cloud computing services, making it a key player in modern technology infrastructure.

AWS professionals help build and maintain cloud infrastructure, ensuring applications are secure, scalable, and efficient. Some popular cloud career paths include cloud engineer, solutions architect, DevOps engineer, and cloud security specialist. Today, I’m most interested in DevOps in AWS—automating deployments, managing CI/CD pipelines, and optimizing cloud-based operations.
