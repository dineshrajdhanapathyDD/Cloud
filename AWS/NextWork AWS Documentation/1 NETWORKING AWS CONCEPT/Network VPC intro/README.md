## I'm building a cloud networking architecture

In this hands-on networking series, I'm learning about how to design, secure, and optimize AWS cloud networks through real-world projects. By the end of the 9 projects, I will have built a complete Virtual Private Cloud from scratch, configured traffic flow, created private subnets, launched resources, tested connectivity, and set up VPC peering, monitoring, and secure access to AWS services like S3 using VPC endpoints. I'm learning about cloud networking because it's a core skill for any cloud professional, essential for building scalable, secure, and efficient cloud architectures that support modern applications and business needs.

Cloud networking is the use of network resources and services—like routing, firewalls, and load balancing—that are hosted in the cloud. It allows communication between cloud-based services, users, and on-premises systems over the internet or private connections. Cloud networking enables scalable, flexible, and secure data exchange, supporting modern applications and remote access while reducing the need for physical infrastructure.

## Excited to share my progress - build a VPC with me!

I will set aside 4 hours every week to work on this networking series and build my cloud skills step by step. I will keep myself accountable by tracking my progress in a journal and sharing updates with my learning community. My reward is the satisfaction of completing all 9 projects, gaining hands-on experience in cloud networking, and getting one step closer to becoming an AWS-certified professional.

### What are networks?

Networks are systems that connect devices like computers, servers, and smartphones to share information and resources. They enable communication between devices using wired or wireless connections. In cloud computing, networks connect virtual resources securely and efficiently, allowing data to flow between services, users, and the internet. Understanding networks is key to building reliable, scalable systems both on-premises and in the cloud.

### What is a VPC?

A VPC is a Virtual Private Cloud that lets you create a secure, isolated network within AWS. You can define IP ranges, subnets, route tables, and gateways to control how your resources communicate. This helps organizations by providing full control over network settings, improving security, and enabling private, scalable, and customizable cloud environments for running applications and services.
