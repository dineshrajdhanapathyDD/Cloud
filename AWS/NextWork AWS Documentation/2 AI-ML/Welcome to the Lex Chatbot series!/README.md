## The Project

In this chatbot series, I'm learning about Amazon Lex, custom slot types, AWS Lambda integration, user data storage, and handling complex conversations with multiple slots.
By the end of the 5 projects, I will have built a fully functional chatbot capable of understanding user intent, storing relevant data, and managing dynamic conversations efficiently.
I'm building a chatbot to enhance user interactions by leveraging AWS services, aiming for a smooth and intelligent conversational experience.

## Hold me accountable!

I will set aside 5 hours each week to work on this project series. I will keep myself accountable by sharing progress updates on LinkedIn and tracking milestones. My reward for completing this chatbot series will be a fully functional AI-powered banking chatbot in my portfolio, boosting my AWS skills and career growth! 

### What is AI in chatbots?

AI in chatbots enables natural conversations by understanding and responding to user queries. AI-powered chatbots use NLP, ML, and deep learning. Key technologies include AWS Lex, GPT, and Dialogflow.

### How does Amazon Lex simplify chatbot development?

Amazon Lex simplifies chatbot development with built-in NLP, automatic speech recognition, and easy AWS integration. It offers pre-built templates, scalable deployment, and seamless connections to Lambda, DynamoDB, and other AWS services, reducing coding effort while enabling smart, conversational AI experiences.
